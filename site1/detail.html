                    Enveloped in mist, nestled within dense forests and silhouetted against snowy peaks of the mighty Himalayas, Shimla is a paradise in the hills. From its British-era lodges that take you back to the old-world to the bustling 12-km-long Ridge, the heartbeat of the city, Shimla, in Himachal Pradesh, is among the most popular hill stations in India. Ringed by seven lofty hills, Shimla is an ideal summer holiday destination and equally popular in winter, when a blanket of snow covers it. An ideal getaway to experience thrilling and adrenaline-pumping sports like skiing, trekking, paragliding and ice skating,
